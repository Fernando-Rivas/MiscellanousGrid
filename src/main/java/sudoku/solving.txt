Functionality
1. Start positions and fixed numbers
Auto solve:
    2.-Initiate plausible grids - set existing numbers
    3.-Remove existing numbers from grids
        3.a-Check all horizontal numbers for pre-existing numbers, if exist remove from plausible
        3.b-Same for vertical
        3.c-Same for inherited 3x3 area zone
    4-Check if any plausible grids are of size 1, aka, only have one plausible number. If so set plausible number in actual
    5-Reset until done
User solve:
    Unsure, check todo list(4)

TL/DR TODO:a
        Upgrade to complex solver
        Upgrade presentation options
        Optional optimization(2)
        Think of new input method, setTo probably ideal tho so unsure




TODO:
    (1)Current method solves easy sudoku, meaning it lacks hypothetical placement
    (2)Implementing a direct removal of a number from the actual grid across its corresponding horizontal and vertical axis
      would probably optimize the regular solving
    (3)Unsure of next level of solving tier, since hypothetical placement can probably be solved easily with another layer
     plausibility options.

TODO:Optional enhancements-(4)
    -Create a user input version:
            Option 1: Completes sudoku, does not allow you to place incorrect numbers
            Option 2: Abides by rule of placement but does not know final result, meaning user may input incorrect number
            due to incorrect logic but no direct ruling which does not allow it.
            *
            Considerations--
                -Clunky
                -Probably would optimize interface/presentation
